This is a simple Rubik's Cube solver. Thanks to Herbert Kociemba and Greg Schmidt for the fabulous algorithm used in this program. Dependencies: qt3, opengl. To build this you need to run `qmake && make`. The project was written in 2008 when I was just a 17-year-old student, so the code is not very beatiful :P
